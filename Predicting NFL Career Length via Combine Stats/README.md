This project revolves around the impossible yet interesting task of predicting the length of the career of an NFL player based on their combine stats. The dataset comes from https://github.com/josedv82/public_sport_science_datasets/tree/main .

The dataset: NFL_Combine_and_pro_day_data_(1987-2021).csv

The headers: Year,Name,College,POS,Height (in),Weight (lbs),Wonderlic,40 Yard,Bench Press,Vert Leap (in),Broad Jump (in),Shuttle,3Cone


TODO:
    Explore the dataset to see duplicates, data distributions, number of unique schools, etc.
    
The first step is to find all the available data regarding the length of as many of the players in the original NFL combine dataset
